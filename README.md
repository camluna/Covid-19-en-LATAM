# Covid 19 in LATAM

<h2>Company 💉🏢 🧬 </h2>   
 
Biogenesys, a leading pharmaceutical company, is searching for ideal locations to expand its pharmaceutical laboratories. Their focus is on detailed analysis of data related to COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, and available healthcare infrastructure in Latin America. The primary goal is to enhance response to the effects of the pandemic and the post-pandemic phase, with the purpose of increasing access to vaccines. 

<h2>Challenges 🧐💻 </h2> 

The project proposes to conduct a study that will contribute to the company's expansion strategy in Latin America, focusing on Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil. Expanding the laboratories is essential to prepare these countries and ensure a prompt response to any future eventualities. Therefore, it is crucial to identify regions and gather relevant data to facilitate decision-making, with the aim of being able to make the necessary investment.

<h2>Results📊💡📑 </h2>

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many shortcomings in the governments of Latin America. While countries like Chile and Argentina managed it better, the figures are staggering, and there is always a feeling that more could have been done. For countries like Brazil and Mexico, the two largest Latin American powers, the number of deaths is the result of misdirected strategies. Although they are the most populous countries in the region, they are also the countries with the greatest economic capacity (at least Brazil), as reflected in the acquisition of large quantities of vaccines. However, there was poor management in getting the population vaccinated. This may also be related to the lack of professionals (doctors, nurses, scientists) to achieve the goal of vaccinating the entire country.

This analysis also allows for the examination of two other major variables affecting Latin Americans: the mortality rate due to pollution - critical figures for Peru - and the percentage of smokers in Chile, which is alarming. Thus, it is also an opportunity to take measures to reduce these two problems.

In conclusion, the analysis confidently determines that the most critical points for Biogenesys to invest in are as follows, in order: Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
